====
There is a bug in the current IMA version where the `CHAIN_CONNECTOR_ROLE` is unassigned at deployment. In order to connect other chains to support S2S transfers, you must first assign this role to TokenManagerLinker.

```javascript
await MessageProxyForSchain.grantRole(CHAIN_CONNECTOR_ROLE, TokenManagerLinker.address)
```
